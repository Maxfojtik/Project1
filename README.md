# Project1

This is the most recent project that Max and Matthew are working on!

The goal is make a strategy game which is both turn based and has time pressure. We're not sure what the final game will be yet.
This game is inspired by Total Annihilation, FTL, and Civ V.

We don't have a name for it yet either, but we'll think of one eventually.
